# Tic Tac Toe

This is a Python implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. The game can be played in the command line interface.

## Installation

To use this program, you need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. If you don't have it installed, you can download and install it from Python's official website.

Once Python is installed, you can download the files from this GitHub repository by clicking the "Clone or download" button and selecting "Download ZIP".

Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer and navigate to that folder in the command line interface.

## Usage

To start the game, run the following command in the command line interface:

The game will start and prompt you to choose whether you want to play as "X" or "O". You will then be prompted to select a block on the board to make your move. The board is represented as follows:

"TR" represents the top right block, "TM" represents the top middle block, and so on. Enter the name of the block you want to select to make your move.

If you select an invalid block, you will be prompted to try again. If you select a block that has already been chosen, you will also be prompted to try again.

The game will continue until one player wins or the board is full. If no one wins, the game will end in a tie.
